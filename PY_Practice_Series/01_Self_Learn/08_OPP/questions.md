## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts with Python
### Concepts Covered

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Basic Class and Object</strong></summary>
Problem: Create a `Car` class with attributes like `brand` and `model`. Then create an instance of this class.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Class Method and Self</strong></summary>
Problem: Add a method to the `Car` class that displays the full name of the car (brand and model).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Inheritance</strong></summary>
Problem: Create an `ElectricCar` class that inherits from the `Car` class and has an additional attribute `battery_size`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Encapsulation</strong></summary>
Problem: Modify the `Car` class to encapsulate the `brand` attribute, making it private, and provide a getter method for it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Polymorphism</strong></summary>
Problem: Demonstrate polymorphism by defining a method `fuel_type` in both `Car` and `ElectricCar` classes, but with different behaviors.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Class Variables</strong></summary>
Problem: Add a class variable to `Car` that keeps track of the number of cars created.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7. Static Method</strong></summary>
Problem: Add a static method to the `Car` class that returns a general description of a car.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>8. Property Decorators</strong></summary>
Problem: Use a property decorator in the `Car` class to make the `model` attribute read-only.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>9. Class Inheritance and `isinstance()` Function</strong></summary>
Problem: Demonstrate the use of `isinstance()` to check if `my_tesla` is an instance of `Car` and `ElectricCar`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>10. Multiple Inheritance</strong></summary>
Problem: Create two classes `Battery` and `Engine`, and let the `ElectricCar` class inherit from both, demonstrating multiple inheritance.
</details>

## Usage

Each concept is explained with a problem statement. Corresponding Python code snippets demonstrate how to implement each concept.
